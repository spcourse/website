# Submit News

Here you can submit your solutions to the problems in your module. Take note:

- Since you need to define your own file-structure for this assignment you need to submit the entire folder as a `.zip`.

- Don't add the datafiles to your `.zip`. The result will be too big.

- Double-check that your programs are correct by checking the outputs _manually_ one last time!

- Check the style of your code. The code you hand in has to observe the style rules as detailed in the [style guide](/python/en/style).

- You may submit and re-submit without limit up until the deadline. However, each time you submit, you need to submit all problems at once.

- In case of problems submitting, ask your teacher or send an e-mail.
