# Syllabus Scientific Programming 2

**Fall 2024/2025**

## General info {#general}

Welcome to this programming course! In the weeks ahead, you’ll use the Python programming language while learning to solve scientific problems from several fields of science. This course is intended for students who have no experience in programming at all. You will learn about the Python language by working on programming problems from several scientific areas.

### Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Scientific Programming 1 assumes no prior programming experience. If you have already done a course in Python, or if you have extensive experience in another programming language, this course might not be your best option—but we’re happy to refer you to other courses if you’d like!

Some modules assume high school mathematics or physics, but in those case you can choose an alternative module that doesn't. If you feel overwhelmed, don’t hesitate to contact the course staff! We can explain the course’s philosophy and requirements, and make recommendations on how to approach problems.

### Learning goals {#goals}

Scientific Programming 1 is a beginner's course. We will teach you the basics of Python programming as well as several different ways of solving computational problems. After this course, we envision that you:

- can transform the description of a simple algorithm into working code by combining basic program elements
- can apply several scientific programming techniques from different areas of study
- can use a couple of libraries in your program and know how to find and read documentation on other libraries
- can make your programs simpler and easier to read by employing a few standard tactics
- can trace and fix several common programming errors

### Course materials {#materials}

All the reading and video material is available on this website. You do not need to purchase any books or software. Every module consists of short explanations (written and in the form of videos) and assignments. _You do need to bring your own laptop._

### Staff {#staff}

Amir Sahrani, Coen van den Elsen, Loes Bijman, Steph Drake, Simon Pauw

### Getting started {#start}

Your entry to the course is the sidebar, where you can leaf through all modules (levels) that you have to complete. To get started:

- Read the rest of the syllabus, below.
- Install Python.
- Choose one of the level 1 modules (Algorithms or Numbers) to get started!

Beware that you don't need to make all modules. **Don't start making them all until you've read below what you need to do.**

### Structure {#structure}

The course is designed to be very flexible. So, there are no compulsory sessions. There are no lectures (except for a kick-off meeting at the start) and the tutorials are optional. The default pace of the course is based on finishing the course in 8 weeks. However, it is possible to extend beyond that up to 16 weeks when needed.

### Help {#help}

The fact that the track is flexible doesn't mean you are on you own. We do provide a lot of help throughout the course with the programming assignments. It is up to you to seek out this help.

There are two ways to get help, the tutorials and the forum:

#### Tutorials

Tutorials (on campus): The tutorials are the most classic way of getting help with your programming. You’ll work on campus (together with other students) in a classroom. You can ask us questions while you’re working on your assignments.

- You can find the **times and locations** here: [Tutorial and exam schedules](/datanose)
- **We highly recommend to join at least one tutorial a week.**
- This is a good place to work on your assignments and get immediate help.
- This is the main place where you can meet other students.

#### Forum

Forum (online): We use Ed as an online discussion platform. Here you can discuss the assignments with other students and also the staff.

- Use the forum: [go to Ed](https://edstem.org/eu/courses/1508)
- If you don't have access yet, please send me an email.

### Programming modules {#programming-modules}

You're going to learn programming through a number of programming modules. Each module consist of:

- Theory: Explanations both written and in the form of video's.
- Practice: Exercises to test your understanding of the theory.
- Assignments: Bigger programming problems, that require combining multiple programming concepts.

The modules are grouped into levels, you have to make one module per level. For some levels you have the choice between two different modules. When there is such a choice, you will learn the same programming concepts, but often in different thematic context (i.e. different scientific fields).

Here below is an overview of all modules for all courses.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>Level 4</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>MONOPOLY</b>. When playing Monopoly, a starting player's advantage seems unfair. To verify, you could play many (millions) real games, but this would take way too much time. Instead, you'll write a computer simulation. This also allows you to experiment with game adjustments to make it fair. You're doing all this for a board game, but this simulation principle applies to various scientific fields (economy, chemistry, biology...).</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 5</b> </td>
    <td>
      <b>COMPLEXITY</b>. What is an efficient algorithm? When you want to run large simulations, analyze large dataset, or any other computationally intensive task, writing efficient algorithms could in some cases mean the difference between a run time of a couple of minutes or of weeks. The theory of computational complexity gives you a way to reason about the efficiency of algorithms and make them run (much) faster.
    </td><td>
      <b>or</b>
    </td><td>
      <b>SHAKESPEARE</b>. Was the play “Arden of Faversham” (1592) written by Shakespeare? A.C. Swinburne thought it was, but T.S. Eliot didn’t. Could we create a computer program that could settle the debate once and for all? It turns out that the answer is: yes… maybe?
    </td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td> <b>Level 6</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>SURVIVAL</b>. Python is very popular for analyzing and processing data. And Pandas is an important reason why. Pandas is the most used Python package for handling data. You will learn how to use this package to analyze and visualize geographical data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <b>BONUS</b> </td><td colspan="3"> <b>POPULATIONS</b>. Predator-prey simulations are models used in ecology and computer science to study the dynamics between populations of predators and their prey within an ecosystem. What's particularly interesting about these simulations is how they can reveal emergent patterns and complex behaviors that arise from relatively simple rules. To make it easier to program such a simulation you will learn a programming technique called object oriented programming (OOP).</td>

## Deadlines {#deadlines}

Deadlines for each level are listed below. If you follow these deadlines you'll have all the assignments finished in time for the corresponding examination moment. You can occasionally diverge a bit from the deadlines, but if you notice that you're structurally behind please contact us.

The deadline schedule:

| Level               |                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Level 4             | Fri **13 Sep** 2024 |

|---------------------|---------------------|


## Grading {#grading}

#### Final grade

The course's final result will be "pass" or "fail", which means that no grades are assigned. You pass by:

- submitting sufficient coursework (as detailed below)
- passing the final exam

#### Coursework (modules)

For each module you will one of the following grades:

* completely correct
* mostly correct
* insufficient

In principle we expect that everything you hand in is *completely correct*. However, it happens easily to miss a detail, so to relax the requirements a bit:

- All your modules need to be at least *mostly correct*.
- At least one module needs to be *completely correct*

You may not re-submit (variations of) solutions that you wrote for any other course's problems. In case you have done similar assignments before, discuss with the course staff whether this is the right course for you.

#### Final exam

The final exam is (on campus) programming exam in a controlled setting. This will take about 3 hours. It contains a couple of small programming assignments. You'll pass the exam when your answers are sufficiently correct.

You can participate in the final exam if you're done with the coursework, meaning:

* The first two modules are *graded* and at least *mostly correct*.
* The last module is handed in (with reasonable expectation to be correct).

If you do not meet these requirements (for example when you still have an insufficient or one of the first two modules isn't graded yet) you cannot participate with the exam yet. You will have to finish the coursework first and do the exam at a later date.

You need to make sure that you leave enough time for grading for the first two modules before the exam. So, **hand in the *first two modules* no later that two weeks before the exam**. If you hand in everything last minute you risk not being able to participate in the exam

## Doing your own work {#plagiarism}

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own (unless explicitly stated otherwise). Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on the course's test and quiz is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

### Reasonable

- Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).
- Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
- Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at office hours, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
- Incorporating a few lines of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those lines are not themselves solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the lines' origins.
- Reviewing past semesters' quizzes and solutions thereto.
- Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Sharing a few lines of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
- Turning to the course's heads for help or receiving help from the course's heads during the quiz or test.
- Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems or your own final project.
- Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
- Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

- Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
- Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.
- Decompiling, de-obfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.
- Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
- Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
- Looking at another individual's work during the test or quiz.
- Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
- Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.
- Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere. So, **avoid** sources like: **Stackoverflow, Google, chatGPT, GitHub, Copilot**, etc.
- Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.
- Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond the few lines allowed herein.
- Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
- Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.
- Turning to humans (besides the course's heads) for help or receiving help from humans (besides the course's heads) during the quiz or test.
- Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.
